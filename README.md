# Bloxstrap Optimization Flags  
All types of flags are combined to achieve the best performance and lowest ping/latency in Roblox.  

To apply these flags, open Bloxstrap, go to **Engine Settings**, scroll down, click on **Fast Flag Editor**, click **Add New**, then click **Import JSON**. Copy everything from `flags.json`, paste it into the input box, click **OK**, and launch Roblox.
